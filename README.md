# My Interpreter project

* This is a pet project in which I follow "Writing an Interpreter in Go".
I'm writing it in C++ instead, to learn interpreter concepts.

* TODO: Make a link to monkey01 and explain it's a fully working lexer, show example.

* All code is under the monkey01/ and monkey02/ folders.
Each subsequent iteration refer to the state of the parser as I get to chapters
in the book "Writing an interpreter in Go"
